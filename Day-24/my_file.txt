 Focus Areas: Unit 7 (Linux Basics: 16 marks), Unit 8 (Process Management and Shell Script:
13 marks), and Units 2, 9 (Arithmetic, Permissions: 10 marks each). These cover 49% of
marks.
 Practice: Set up a Linux environment (Ubuntu/VM) for hands-on practice with commands (ls,
grep, chmod), shell scripting, and file operations. Practice binary arithmetic and addressing
modes for Computer Organization.
 Key Topics: Linux commands, shell scripting, process scheduling, memory hierarchy, I/O
interrupts, floating-point representation.
 Exam Tips: Solve MCQs on Testbook or Sanfoundry for theory. Practice Linux commands daily
and write shell scripts for common tasks (e.g., file manipulation).
